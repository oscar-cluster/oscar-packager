1.3.6:
- [ol] fix given/when warnings.
1.3.5:
- [ol] Update to support debian pool subdir in repository when moving files.
1.3.4:
- [ol] Add support for PACKAGER_SOURCES_URL_BASE in /etc/oscar/oscar.conf
1.3.3:
- [ol] fix doc generation (use docbook2html instead of sgmltools to generate
- [ol] add support for SuSE/openSuSE build
html doc
1.3.2:
- [ol] support git checkout and partial checkouts.
1.3.1:
- [ol] do not build debuginfo packages in rpm based distros.
1.3.0:
- [ol] Now works with GIT and new oscar git repo.
1.2.9:
- [ol] Add squid opkg
1.2.8:
- [ol] Now update the repo index after each bunch of packages moved to the
repo. This allows to build deps in the same build.cfg file.
for example: if we need package_A to build package_B, this is now possible.
==== build.Cfg ====
[rhel:*:*]
requires: dep1 dep2
package_A
requires: package_A dep3 dep4
package_B
===================
1.2.7:
- [ol] Now clean the PATH variable from all links to avoid bad AutoReqProv
dependancies in rpm packages on recent distro where /bin and /sbin are links
to their /usr counterparts. If those links are not filtered, as oscar-packager
runs as root, a PATH with /sbin:/bin before /usr/sbin:/usr/bin (bashrc and
sudoers Defaults secure_paths) will lead to /bin/python dep instead of
/usr/bin/python dependancy. this bad dep will cause yume to fail to upgrade
python package as it wrongly thinks that /bin/python deps would be broken.
1.2.6:
- [ol] Updated unstable.cfg files (netbootmgr in core)
1.2.5:
- [ol] BUGFIX: precommand in <package>.cfg was not executed if source was not a
src.rpm. (tarball for rpm and deb)
1.2.4:
- [ol] BUGFIX: Removed duplicate switcher entry in included_opkgs_unstable.cfg
1.2.3:
- [ol] Add support for "nobuild: <reason>" in build.cfg to disable a build for a
specific distro.
- [ol] Add --ignore-nobuild to force build of disabled packages.
- [ol] Now rebuild the repo indexes at each successfull package built so
- [ol] Now check that at least we have --all or --core or --included
freshly built packages can be used in next pkg requires:
1.2.2:
- [ol] Do not fail when no instruction to build is available.
- [ol] Make opkg build log similar to package build log.
- [ol] Added git support (method = git) for retreiving sources.
- [ol] Added mercurial support (method = hg) for retreiving sources.
- [ol] bugfix
1.2.1:
- [ol] bugfix release
- [ol] New function set_built_status to enable / disable built status.
- [ol] build natively in debian if debian/changelog exists (instead of
debian/control). This permit to have debian/changelog.in and then rely on
Makefile (make deb)
1.2.0:
- [ol] Major rewrite of the build algorythm. No more duplicated build.
- [ol] Now oscar-packager can build a package the same way on deb and on rpm
(optionnaly using build.cfg) and using 1st debian/ or .spec and at last
Makefile (make rpm|deb).
- [ol] Removed the build_{rpm,deb}.sh usage (not needed).
- [ol] Now, oscar-packager moves the built packagei(s) itself. Now, it parses
the build output, collect the exact names of packages that are built and
moves them into the repo. No more glob used to try to collect resulting
packages.
=> No more need to put logic in makefile to move resulting packages to
PKGDEST.
- [ol] Greatly improved the logging output.
- [ol] Added Tk-TextANSIColor package (both debian and rpm).
1.1.3:
- Migrated to new OSCAR::Logger mechanism.
- When building from a spec file (from svn), parses the spec file to compute
the archive name and guess the archive root directory name. (we do not parse
the %setup line already (no need such precision for the moment).
1.1.2:
- [ol] Now oscar-packager 1st try to build package from distro packaging files
(debian dir or spec file). Then it tries as a last resort a make rpm.
- [ol] Now oscar packager is able to build an rpm from tarball or svn using
spec file fount in toplevel of archive.
1.1.1:
- [ol] Add support for generic package names like perl(Pod::Man) or glibc-devel(x86-32)
1.1.0:
- [ol] build_package: avoid polluting --output directory with build materials (tarball, temp files, extracted files, ...)
- [ol] Add support for building packages that have no build.cfg on debian (from svn or extracted tarball).
  - Build using make deb if a Makefile is present.
  - Build using dpkg-buildpackage if debian/control file exists.
- [ol] Don't forget to move resulting rpm if source is an src.rpm
- [dikim] More intelligent building process for the oscar packages and opkgs:
  - Added support for make_rpm.sh and make_deb.sh build script
  - Added support for precommand in <package>.cfg with support for
    BASE_DIR, PKG_NAME, SRC_DIR.
  - Add "option" field in config file (--define , --target x86_64,i686 ...)
- [ol] Now debian build without Makefile is supported: if package.cfg has a tarball and:
  - it contains a debian/control file
  - or the source (from /etc/oscar/oscar-packager/*.cfg contains a debian/control file
- [ol] Now debian use extract_files, so archives can be .tar.bz2 or .tgz or .tar.xz now.
- [ol] Made package_core and package_included a single generic routine allowing to
  add more type like contrib for example.
- [ol] don't stay in current working directory to build rpms. Rather move to
  /tmp/oscar-packager/$name to avoid doing blind mv commands...
- [ol] Add missing Requires: packman, opkgc
- [ol] Stop build package on error and skip to next one avoiding to wrongly report
  a success.
- [ol] Output reworked a lot to ease reading and debug. $debug and $verbose
  forwarded to Packager.pm
- [ol] Don't stop build if one package in main(core) or main(included) fails.
  Still build opkgs.
- [ol] Correct reports of all errors at the end of the build.
- [ol] Setup PKGDEST env variable before calling build_{deb,rpm}.sh script.
- [ol] Added:
  - systemimager + bittorent + flamethrower
  - systemconfigurator
  - systeminstaller-oscar
  - oscar-packager
  - opkgc
  - pvm
  - network-configurator
  - loghost
  - oscar-v
  - oscar-installer
  - oscar-nat
  - system-update
  - jobmonarch + pyPgSQL + pbs_python
  - kernel-picker
- [ol] Fixed self destruct when building itself: would remove
  /tmp/oscar-packager/oscar-packager (self) when preparing build environment.
  Now we use normal archive name with version in it.
- [ol] Take into account that the rpm command is either located in /bin or /usr/bin.
- [dikim & ol] Fixed Packager.pm to support {} in source allowing for more than one source
  to be downloaded. The main source must be the 1st one.
  example:
  http://url_to_donwload_site/{main_archive.tar.gz,main_archive/addon.png, ...}
- [ol] Fixed Packager.pm building package without build options specified in the
  builc.cfg file.
- [ol] Fixed oscar-packager to build only once the package instead of 5 times in
  case of an src.rpm in the package.cfg accompanied with a Makefile in the svn
  tree.
- [ol] Moved all %SOURCE and %PATCHES files that were in opkg/<name>/trunk/rpm
  into a subdirectory so it's easy to copy only files specific to a spec file
  It also permit to have a file with the same name E.g. README in 2 different
  subpackage like drmaa-python and toque-oscar.
- [ol] Parsed the build command output to retreave exactly what was build. this
  avoids to blindly move packages or unwanted files into the dest dir (repos)
- [ol] Upgraded:
  - torque to 4.1.4
  - c3 to 5.1.3
  - ganglia to 3.5.7 (web) and 3.5.0 (daemons)
  - jobmonarch to 1.1 (final release)
- [dikim] Add the possibility to build only one specific package
  e.g. "oscar-packager --included openmpi unstable" will only build opnempi.

1.0.1:
- Add configuration files for oscar-6.1.1 and oscar-6.1.2.
- Updated configuration files for oscar-unstable
- Various bug fixes.
- Fix spec file Summary.

1.0:
- Add configuration file for oscar-6.0, oscar-6.0.1, and oscar-6.0.2.
- Initial release.
- Allows the creation of binary packages for OSCAR core (stable and unstable)
on both RPM and Debian based systems.
