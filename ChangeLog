1.1.0:
- [dikim] More intelligent building process for the oscar packages and opkgs:
  - Added support for make_rpm.sh and make_deb.sh build script
  - Added support for precommand in <package>.cfg with support for
    BASE_DIR, PKG_NAME, SRC_DIR.
  - Add "option" field in config file (--define , --target x86_64,i686 ...)
- [ol] Now debian build without Makefile is supported: if package.cfg has a tarball and:
  - it contains a debian/control file
  - or the source (from /etc/oscar/oscar-packager/*.cfg contains a debian/control file
- [ol] Now debian use extract_files, so archives can be .tar.bz2 or .tgz or .tar.xz now.
- [ol] Made package_core and package_included a single generic routine allowing to
  add more type like contrib for example.
- [ol] don't stay in current working directory to build rpms. Rather move to
  /tmp/oscar-packager/$name to avoid doing blind mv commands...
- [ol] Add missing Requires: packman, opkgc
- [ol] Stop build package on error and skip to next one avoiding to wrongly report
  a success.
- [ol] Output reworked a lot to ease reading and debug. $debug and $verbose
  forwarded to Packager.pm
- [ol] Don't stop build if one package in main(core) or main(included) fails.
  Still build opkgs.
- [ol] Correct reports of all errors at the end of the build.
- [ol] Setup PKGDEST env variable before calling build_{deb,rpm}.sh script.
- [ol] Added:
  - systemimager + bittorent + flamethrower
  - systemconfigurator
  - systeminstaller-oscar
  - oscar-packager
  - opkgc
  - pvm
  - network-configurator
  - loghost
  - oscar-v
  - oscar-installer
  - oscar-nat
  - system-update
  - jobmonarch + pyPgSQL + pbs_python
  - kernel-picker
- [ol] Fixed semf destruct when building itself: would remove
  /tmp/oscar-packager/oscar-packager (self) when preparing build environment.
  Now we use normal archive name with version in it.
- [ol] Take into account that the rpm command is either located in /bin or /usr/bin.
- [dikim & ol] Fixed Packager.pm to support {} in source allowing for more than one source
  to be downloaded. The main source must be the 1st one.
  example:
  http://url_to_donwload_site/{main_archive.tar.gz,main_archive/addon.png, ...}
- [ol] Fixed Packager.pm building package without build options specified in the
  builc.cfg file.
- [ol] Fixed oscar-packager to build only once the package instead of 5 times in
  case of an src.rpm in the package.cfg accompanied with a Makefile in the svn
  tree.
- [ol] Moved all %SOURCE and %PATCHES files that were in opkg/<name>/trunk/rpm
  into a subdirectory so it's easy to copy only files specific to a spec file
  It also permit to have a file with the same name E.g. README in 2 different
  subpackage like drmaa-python and toque-oscar.
- [ol] Parsed the build command output to retreave exactly what was build. this
  avoids to blindly move packages or unwanted files into the dest dir (repos)
- [ol] Upgraded:
  - torque to 4.1.4
  - c3 to 5.1.3
  - ganglia to 3.5.7 (web) and 3.5.0 (daemons)
  - jobmonarch to 1.0 (final release)
- [dikim] Add the possibility to build only one specific package
  e.g. "oscar-packager --included openmpi unstable" will only build opnempi.

1.0.1:
- Add configuration files for oscar-6.1.1 and oscar-6.1.2.
- Updated configuration files for oscar-unstable
- Various bug fixes.
