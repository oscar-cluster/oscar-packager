1.1.0 (not yet released):
- Moved all %SOURCE and %PATCHES files that were in opkg/<name>/trunk/rpm
into a subdirectory so it's easy to copy only files specific to a spec file
It also permit to have a file with the same name E.g. README in 2 different
subpackage like drmaa-python and toque-oscar.
- Optimized build_package and Packager.pm by using "rpmspec -q" or
"rpm -q --specfile" to retreve the exact filenames of all binary rpms that
will be generated. This avoid to blindly copy old versions of the same rpm
in the repository.
- Upgraded c3 to 5.1.3 (new version) [ol]
- Add the possibility to build only one specific package [dikim]
  e.g. "oscar-packager --included openmpi unstable" will only build opnempi.

- Add configuration files for oscar-6.1.1 and oscar-6.1.2.
- Updated configuration files for oscar-unstable
