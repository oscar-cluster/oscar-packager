1.1.0 (not yet released):
- Mand package_core and package_included a single generic routine allowing to
add more type like contribe for example.
- don't tay in current working directory to build rpms. Rather move to
  /tmp/oscar-packager/$name to avoid doing blind mv commands...
- Add "option" field in config file (--define , --target x86_64,i686 ...)
- Add missing Requires: packman, opkgc
- Stop build package on error and skip to next one avoiding to wrongly report
a success.
- Output reworked a lot to ease reading and debug. $debug and $verbose
  forwarded to Packager.pm
- Don't stop build if one package in main(core) or main(included) fails.
  Still build opkgs.
- Correct reports of all errors at the end of the build.
- Setup PKGDEST env variable before calling build_{deb,rpm}.sh script.
- Added:
  - systemimager + bittorent + flamethrower
  - systemconfigurator
  - systeminstaller-oscar
  - oscar-packager
  - opkgc
  - pvm
  - network-configurator
  - loghost
  - oscar-v
  - oscar-installer
  - oscar-nat
  - system-update
  - jobmonarch + pyPgSQL + pbs_python
  - kernel_picker
- Fixed semf destruct when building itself: would remove
/tmp/oscar-packager/oscar-packager (self) when preparing build environment.
Now we use normal archive name with version in it.
- Take into account that the rpm command is either located in /bin or
/usr/bin.
- Fixed Packager.pm to support {} in source allowing for more than one source
to be downloaded. The main source must be the 1st one.
example:
http://url_to_donwload_site/{main_archive.tar.gz,main_archive/addon.png, ...}
- Fixed Packager.pm building package without build options specified in the
builc.cfg file.
- Fixed oscar-packager to build only once the package instead of 5 times in
case of an src.rpm in the package.cfg accompanied with a Makefile in the svn
tree.
- Moved all %SOURCE and %PATCHES files that were in opkg/<name>/trunk/rpm
into a subdirectory so it's easy to copy only files specific to a spec file
It also permit to have a file with the same name E.g. README in 2 different
subpackage like drmaa-python and toque-oscar.
- Optimized build_package and Packager.pm by using "rpmspec -q" or
"rpm -q --specfile" to retreve the exact filenames of all binary rpms that
will be generated. This avoid to blindly copy old versions of the same rpm
in the repository.
- Upgraded c3 to 5.1.3 (new version) [ol]
- Add the possibility to build only one specific package [dikim]
  e.g. "oscar-packager --included openmpi unstable" will only build opnempi.
