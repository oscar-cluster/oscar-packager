<sect1><title>Introduction</title>

<para>
  OSCAR is based on binary packages: both the OSCAR core and OSCAR packages are
  shipped and managed via binary packages. Those binary packages have to be
  generated for all new supported Linux distribution (module architecture 
  independent binary package on Linux distributions having the same
  configuration). oscar-packager aims to ease the creation of those binary
  packages, generating them automatically for the local platform.
</para>

</sect1>

<sect1><title>Access to Source Code</title>
  <para>
    The generation of binary packages require the access to the source code of
    the software that needs to be packaged. The source code may be available in
    many different ways: tarballs, svn check-out, SRPMs. Since OSCAR components
    use those different methods of source code distribution, oscar-packager must
    hide those details to the packager and deal with this different
    configuration.
  </para>
  <para>
    Because OSCAR is two kinds of components, core components and OSCAR
    packages, it is convenient to be able to compile one those groups of
    packages or both of them at the same time. Moreover, one may want to compile
    the stable version of the OSCAR components, others may want to compile the
    unstable (development) version.
    To do that, four configuration files are available:
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>
        Two configuration files for core packages: one for the stable version
	and one for the unstable version.
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>
        Two configuration files for OPKGs:  one for the stable version
	and one for the unstable version.
	</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    Those configuration files describe how to access the source code of the
    OSCAR component to compile. The following example specifies that the stable
    version of ODA is available via SVN, at a specific URL:
    <programlisting>
      <![CDATA[
[oda]
source  = svn,http://svn.oscar.openclustergroup.org/svn/oscar/pkgsrc/oda/tags/oda-1.3
              ]]>
    </programlisting>
  </para>
  <para>
    <emphasis>
      oscar-packager does not aim to implement the policy regarding the storage
      of code source (for instance to guarantee we can repackage any release of
      OSCAR at any time). oscar-packager is only a simple tool that aims to
      enable the automatic generation of binary packages for OSCAR based on a
      description (though configuration files) of the location of the source
      code and the method to use for the actual creation of the binary packages.
    </emphasis>
  </para>
</sect1>

<sect1><title>Automatic Generation of Binary Packages</title>
  <para>
    Once we have access to the source code, we need to know how to generate the
    binary packages. Typically, we need to:
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
          know the dependencies required for the creation of the binary package,
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
        specify some environment variables needed for the creation of the binary
        package,
	</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
        where to save the binary packages (the location is different for
        architecture independent and architecture dependent binary packages).
	</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    To specify this data, each OSCAR component must provide a 
    <emphasis>build.cfg</emphasis> file. This capability is actually from a
    previous effort, initiated by Erich Focht from NEC Europe; we only extend it
    for the support of Debian packages.
  </para>
  <para>
    With this data, it is possible to generate the binary packages: 
    oscar-packager gets the source code, parse the build.cfg file and finally
    execute the command for the creation of the binary package. For that,
    oscar-oackages automatically detect the binary package format of the local
    Linux distribution.
  </para>
</sect1>

<sect1>
  <title>
    Generation of a Local Repository for the Storage of Generated Binary
    Packages
  </title>

  <para>
    In order to ease the usage of the generated binary packages, those binary
    packages are automatically copied into a local repository. This local 
    repository is the standard OSCAR repositories, i.e., the different 
    repositories available in <emphasis>/tftpboot/distro</emphasis> and
    <emphasis>/tftpboot/oscar</emphasis>.
  </para>
  <para>
    !!WARNING!! Even if the repositories are fully functional, they won't be
    necessarly used by default by OSCAR, you MUST check the repository 
    configuration files.
  </para>
</sect1>

<sect1><title>Scripts for Binary Package Creation Before OSCAR-5.2</title>

<para>
  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>
      build_all_rpms: build binary package for all OPKGs (not including the
      meta-packages).
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
      build_opkg_rpms: create the meta-packages for a given list of OPKGs.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
      build_oscar_rpms: create all binary packages (except meta-packages) for a
      given list of OPKGs, and install them in local repositories.
      This script is based on a build.cfg file that describes how to prepare the
      system for the creation of binary packages and how to create those binary 
      packages.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
      build_rpms: Script for building RPMs and SRPMS from a source tree
      directory and a spec file.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
</para>

<para>
build_all_rpms calls build_oscar_rpms and build_oscar_rpms calls build_rpms at the back-end
</para>
